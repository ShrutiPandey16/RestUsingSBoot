*   Stateless -> communication method in which the server completes every client request independently of all previous requests.

*   REST -> Representation State Transfer
        R -> In a proper format(e.g. json, xml etc) Representation of a resource not the resource itself.
        S -> Current condition or data of the resource at an instance. REST is stateless.
        T -> The state is transferred from the server to the client via HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

*   REST uses Noun rather than Verb. Eg. .../addAJob -> .../job

*   1. start the server, we can create pseudo server by installing json-server    
        npm i json-server
    2. run server
        json-server --watch db.json --port 8080  
    2. install all the packages
        npm i
